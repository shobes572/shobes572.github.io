## Portfolio Goals
1. to use the following: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

## Notes
> The primary base for a functioning portfolio is now in place with placeholder images for the My Work sections

> I've made some stylistic choices that may be questionable but am actively working on tweaking them to make the page more appealing

> The cards are `functioning` but can definitely be improved

> as a whole the page is responsive

## ToDo
> improve the responsiveness of the page

> CSS Consolidation

> improve the styling choices

> add active links to projects as they develop

> add an updated resume

> replace the _About Me_ text
